# ShapeWorld Data: Emergent Communication of Generalizations

Dataset code accompanying NeurIPS 2021 submission, Emergent Communication of
Generalizations.

## Usage

Tested with `python3.8` though most versions should do. Install dependencies in
`requirements.txt`, then run

- `emergent_generalization_shapeworld.sh` to make `shapeworld`
- `emergent_generalization_shapeworld_ref.sh` to make `shapeworld_ref`
- `emergent_generalization_shapeworld_all.sh` to make `shapeworld_all`

The specific datasets are explained in the main codebase README.
